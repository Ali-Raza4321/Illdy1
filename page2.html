    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right"></i>FLARIS LAR 01<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-left"></i></h1>
    <p>The first and only aircraft of its type in the world, FLARIS LAR 01 unites jet-tier performance with <br> levels of safety and economic accessibility previously reserved solely for small general aviation <br> units. The cutting-edge construction made overcoming many traditional limitations possible and <br> resulted in creation of an internationally exceptional aircraft!</p>
</div>
<div class="ali6">
    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right"></i>FEATURES<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-left"></i></h1>
    <p>FLARIS LAR 1 is a single-engine jet aircraft with lightweight, composite <br> construction. It creates a new category of small, agile jets, ideal for quick movement <br> for any purpose</p>
    <div class="ali7">
        <h4>SOAR TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF COMFORT</h4>
        <p>The intuition of piloting FLARIS LAR 1 is <br> apparent in its minimal operations, secure stall, <br> and automatic spin recovery. The jet was <br> designed to be flown by a single pilot (with <br> Garmin G600 Txi radio and navigation system <br> and FFAS® interactive onboard computer <br> acting as a copilot). The only qualification <br> required to fly FLARIS LAR 1 is a Private Pilot <br> License (PPL).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ali8"></div>
    <div class="ali9"></div>
    <div class="ali10">
        <h4>REVOLUTIONARY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY <br> FRIENDLY AVIATION</h4>
        <p>FLARIS LAR 1 is one tonne lighter than VLJ <br> aircraft and initiates a brand new category of <br> High-Speed Personal Jet. Light construction, <br> extraordinary aerodynamics, and a cutting-edge <br> FJ33-5A engine operated with an ECU computer <br> allowed a significant reduction of fuel <br> consumption and exhaust gas emission. <br> Consequently, FLARIS LAR 1 is environmentally <br> friendly.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="ali11">
    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right"></i>COCKPIT<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-left"></i></h1>
    <p>FLARIS LAR 1 is equipped with a versatile Garmin G600 Txi radio and navigation system that acts as a copilot and <br> minimizes the number of equipment distracting the pilot.</p>
</div>
<div class="ali12">
    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right"></i>SAFETY<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-left"></i></h1>
    <p>It is a light jet aircraft of a completely new type, being approachable for amateurs and satisfying the expectations of <br> experienced pilots at the same time</p>
<div class="ali13"></div>
<div class="ali14">
    <h4>LIFT-TO-DRAG RATIO</h4>
    <p>Thanks to its exceptional lift-to-drag ratio of <br> 18 which is comparable to that of a glider and <br> a drop-shaped semi-monocoque fuselage, <br> FLARIS LAR 1 is able to glide 18 kilometers <br> for every kilometer of altitude loss <br> in a power-off setting. This gives the pilot <br> a lot of time to find a landing site in case of <br> emergency. Just a 250-meter-long grass <br> airstrip will enable you to perform a safe <br> landing, thanks to a solid landing gear.</p>
    <div class="ali15">
        <h4>SAFETY SYSTEM</h4>
        <p>FLARIS LAR 1 is equipped with a modern <br> parachute rescue system for the whole <br> aircraft.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="ali16">
    <h4>NAVIGATION SYSTEM</h4>
    <p>The avionic system of Flaris LAR uses a popular <br> G600Txi system which provides maximal safety <br> and convenience for the user. The GTN-750 <br> navigation system (GPS) placed in the center of <br> the dashboard, combines navigating function with <br> operating additional devices, including a radio <br> station and a transponder. It is equipped with <br> a touch screen which helps to navigate a user- <br> friendly icon menu.</p>

<div class="ali18">
    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right"></i>FUSELAGE<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-left"></i></h1>
    <p>FLARIS LAR 1 is ultra-light and durable thanks to its hybrid structure.  It is made mostly of pre-impregnated carbon fibers, found <br> in the most modern long-haul aircraft, like A350 or Dreamliner. To ensure highest durability and safety, the most vital large <br> elements of the construction (wing spars, landing-gear struts, supports of control surfaces, etc.) are milled from aluminum, using <br> numerical control technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="ali19">
    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right"></i>PROPULSION<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-left"></i></h1>
     <p>The solid and reliable FJ33-5 engine makes the Flaris jet safer than other light aircraft. Turbofan engines are much more reliable <br> than reciprocating engines, and the FJ33 turbofan employed on Flaris is especially reliable due to its mature and robust design. The <br> design of FJ33 is based directly on the larger FJ44 engine family which accumulated over 10,000,000 flight hours in total, so the <br> engine concept has proven itself to be trustworthy. The titanium fan was proven so tough that Williams International covers foreign <br> object damage (FOD) costs in its versatile and convenient engine maintenance program called TAP Blue. </p>
     <div class="ali20">
        <h4>UNYIELDING QUALITY</h4>
        <p>All parts and labor needed for the maintenance of <br> FJ33 engine are provided by authorized service <br> centers of Williams International. To enhance <br> safety, all of our engines have been included in the <br> Total Assurance Program (TAP Blue) by Williams <br> lnternational. TAP Blue provides complete <br> maintenance of the engine, and there are <br> no added costs for the customer beyond a small <br> fee per flight-hour, so the customers are keen <br> to act quickly in bringing any concerns to the <br> service center, and to keep all of their engine <br> inspections up to date.</p>

    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right"></i>EXTERIOR DESIGN<i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-left"></i></h1>
    <p>Flaris LAR1 introduces new quality to private air transport. To complement the idea of creating means of private transportation, <br> we encourage the owners to have their jet painted according to their personal preference, so the liveries highlight the private <br> nature of the aircraft and manifest their personality.</p>
